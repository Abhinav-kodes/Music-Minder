# Music-Minder

Adaptive volume control for background music: Music-Minder automatically detects when other audio (like videos or calls) starts playing in your browser and gently lowers the volume of your background music tab. Works on all sites, not just YouTubeâ€”perfect for keeping your music in the background while you watch videos or join meetings online. Simple, site-agnostic, and privacy-friendly
